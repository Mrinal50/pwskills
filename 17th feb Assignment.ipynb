    "#Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "#MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER--\n",
    "MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. \n",
    "The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, \n",
    "and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different\n",
    "from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lesser Server Cost and Open-Source NoSQL databases are cheap and open source.\n",
    "NoSQL database implementation is easy and typically uses cheap servers to manage the exploding data and transaction\n",
    "while RDBMS databases are expensive and it uses big servers and storage systems."

    "\n",
    "Features of MongoDB\n",
    "These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Support ad hoc queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and\n",
    "can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Duplication of data\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up \n",
    "and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "#6. Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. It is a schema-less database written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. Provides high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
    "#11. Easy to administer in the case of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#12. It also supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON data model with dynamic schemas\n",
    "Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability\n",
    "Built in replication for high availability\n"
